# Setting up MIT Scheme

1. Download MIT Scheme from [here](https://groups.csail.mit.edu/mac/ftpdir/mit-scheme/), select the appropriate version for your OS.

2. If you're on Ubuntu or other Debian based flavor, you can use `sudo apt install mit-scheme` to install it.

3. Get the VSCode Extension [vscode-scheme](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=sjhuangx.vscode-scheme) (assuming you're using VSCode for SICP)
  > This doesn't do a whole lot, it just provides some pretty syntax coloring. It can definitely help with seeing clarity in the syntax.

4. Name your scheme program files with the `.scm` extension
5. To enter into REPL run `scheme` or `mit-scheme`
6. To exit you can either use `(quit)` or `(exit)`
7. Here's hello world in Scheme: `(display "Hello, world")`
